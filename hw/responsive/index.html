<section> <h3>Mock-Up Campaign</h3> </section>

<section> <p> Miss Representation </p> </section>

<section> <p>Miss Representation is a documentary directed by Jennifer Siebel Newsom that highlights
the objectification and misrepresentation of women in the media, government, and workforce.
The film explains the different ways the media takes advantage of how the ideal woman
should look like and act. For example, ever since women are little girls, they are convinced
men’s independence translates into women’s dependence on them. Stereotypes like the one
mentioned above have significant negative impact on our society and female development.
According to the documentary, the underrepresentation of women in the media can
lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety as well as substance abuse
and domestic violence. It is up to our generation to put an end to female objectification.
Miss Representation calls for policy change, awareness, mentorship, education and asks
its viewers to visualize a world with more female leaders, gender equality, and a diverse
media, government, and workforce. Representation, diversity and respect are the answers.</p> </section>

<section> <h3>Brand Campaign</h3> </section>
<section> <p> Cuatro Por Venezuela </p></section>

<section> <p>Cuatro por Venezuela Brand Book Design was my first ever brand-book design, and organization re-design. I loved branding and would love to keep working on it throughout the future. As I began to design, I framed my thoughts around the idea of holding on to HOPE. What do I mean by hope? Hope of recuperating the beautiful country of Venezuela and the feeling of bringing aid to those most in need. My approach throughout is very minimalistic and geometric. I chose a blue/yellow colored designs. I chose yellow because, in the Venezuelan culture, it symbolizes good luck and joy. As its compliments, light and darker blue, which deliver the visuals through a calming and serene presence. I was inspired by the “Harina Pan” package (the corn meal used to make typical Arepas) and the Venezuela Live Aid concert’s stage design. </p> </section>
