   <h3 class="experience">Data Collection Research Assistant</h3>
   <p class="experience_1">The Clinton Foundation along with the Community Outreach Research Project Department of Psychology (University of Miami) and Publix supermarkets
   partnered to conduct a study evaluating parent/child interactions in public spaces.
   Places like supermarkets and laundry mats can be a  very tough place to go with young children;
   therefore, through a series of methods, the Clinton Foundation wanted to encourage educational conversations between parents and children in public spaces.
    Research assistants, like myself, collected observational data in supermarkets and studied the different interactions.</p>
