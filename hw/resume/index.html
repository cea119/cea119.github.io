   <b class="experience">Undergraduate Researcher</b>
   <p id="experience_1"> I have been a part of the COMET Study since my freshman year at the University of Miami. As an undergraduate researcher (RA),
     I take part in  supervised and solo assessments. Throughout the assesments, participants' levels of depression, anxiety,
     and other psychological condicions are evaluated. When not performing assessments,
     I conduct phone screening taks to schedule future assessments and recruit potential particpants, as well as input the data gathered in the RedCap Software.
     I also create social media material for the COMET Study to be featured in the UMiami Psychology Department Instagram page.  </p>

   <section>
    <b class="experience">Athletic Tutor</b>
   <p id="experience_1">As an athletic tutor at the University of Miami, I take part in helping student athletes succeed academically.
      On a weekly basis, I apply my strong communications skills by demonstrating a strong understanding of the subjects at hand.
      I mainly tutor in mathematics, psychology, marketing, and languages (Spanish and French).</p>



   <b class="experience">Travel Blog Editor</b>
   <p id="experience_1">Distraction is the University of Miami’s current and trendy student-run magazine.
   As Travel Blog Editor, I am a part of the magazine’s core staff.   Since Spring 2019, I began to work with the magazine’s online section,
   where I have been able to strengthen my writing, editing, and design skills.
   As an editor, I have the  opportunity to write and design,
   as well as collaborate with other writers and designers who submit their travel related articles to
   be featured in the website.</p>


     <b class="experience">Orientation Fellow</b>
     <p id="experience_1">As an Orientation Fellow, I led a group of University of Miami, first-year students throughout their orientation week, also known as ‘Cane Kickoff.
   Through this opportunity, I played an important role in making sure first-year  students  felt  comfortable and had a smooth transition into college life.
   I  gained extensive leadership skills, shared my advice as  well as spread my love for the University of Miami while meeting incredible University of Miami
   students, faculty, and staff leading to new friendships and connections.</p>
   <!-- Being  an OF was one of the coolest experiences -->


   <b class="experience">NSAC Strategic Planner</b>
     <p id="experience_1">The National Student Advertising Competition is a student advertising competition that provides college students the opportunity to gain real-world experience
        by creating a 360 marketing campaign for a designated client.
        After developing the  campaign, a team of students  pitch  their ideas and executions to advertising professionals
         while competing against other nation-wide colleges. This Fall 2019, I am a part of the strategy team.
         My job includes gathering data through distinct research methods, come up with insights, and  ultimately create a kick-ass brief.</p>

   <b class="experience">PhilADtropy Strategic Planner/Designer</b>

   <p id="experience_1">Along with a team of University of Miami students, we created a 360 marketing campaign for the annual PhilADtropy event,
   which benefits non-profit organizations based in Florida.
   This year, the event hosted non-profits that were founded after the tragedy that occurred
   at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
   Throughout this experience, the participants  execute the entire campaign in 25 hours.</p>

   <b class="experience">One Club Created Bootcamp Strategic Planner/Designer</b>
   <p id="experience_1">I was invited to take part in The One Club’s Creative Bootcamp program.
     Through the camp, I worked  with Miami-based multicultural and diverse students and professionals.
     In the course of four-days,  I was introduced to the advertising industry, as I learned about the complex process,
      high-stress, and effort required to succeed in the advertising industry.
       Along with a team of three creatives, we created and presented a campaign for a real life client.
       This year, the camp’s host was The Community Agency in Miami and the client was Verizon.</p>

   <b class="experience">Data Collection Research Assistant</b>
   <p id="experience_1">The Clinton Foundation along with the Community Outreach Research Project Department of Psychology (University of Miami) and Publix supermarkets
   partnered to conduct a study evaluating parent/child interactions in public spaces.
   Places like supermarkets and laundry mats can be a  very tough place to go with young children;
   therefore, through a series of methods, the Clinton Foundation wanted to encourage educational conversations between parents and children in public spaces.
    Research assistants, like myself, collected observational data in supermarkets and studied the different interactions.</p>
