<p>
    I am a University of Miami junior double majoring in <b class="embrace"> Advertising Management and Interactive Media </b> as well as minoring in Psychology. I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, yet moved to the US when I was 12 years old.</p>

  <p>
 Creativity, originality, and understanding human behavior motivate me to become a successful <b class="embrace"> strategic planner and designer</b>. I am passionate about learning and challenging myself.  These are some of the pieces I have been working on over the past few years. Hope you like them. :)

<section> <p>I designed this magazine in November 2018. It was my first time ever exploring and learning to use Indesign. I loved creating this projectt- it is still one of my favorites. At the end of the semester, I sent the magazine to print to a professional printer, and it came out looking as cool as ever! </p> </section>
