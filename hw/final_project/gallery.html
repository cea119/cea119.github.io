<h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1>

<p>
    I am a junior majoring in Advertising and Interactive Media and minoring in Psychology. I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, yet moved to the US when I was 12 years old.  I am currently a student at the University of Miami where I study Advertising with a focus on Management.</p>

  <p>
 Creativity, originality, and understanding human behavior motivate me to become a successful strategic planner and designer. I am passionate about learning and challenging myself.  These are some of the pieces I have been working on over the past few years. Hope you like them.
