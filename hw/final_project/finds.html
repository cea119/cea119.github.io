<p>Although social media and all the content we are exposed to online can be detrimential to our mental health, it also has a very powerful aspect to it: <b class="embrace">connection</b>.

	<p> A lot of the content published online is conent that has little social value; there are a lot of good people, teams, and companies who promote <b class="embrace"> well-being, happiness, peace, & connection </b>. Here, I share some of my favorite go-to Instagram accounts, books, podcasts, and videos that <b class="embrace"> inspire </b> me daily. Enjoy!   </p>


<h2>Instagram Accounts</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Cultura Positiva</li>
	<p class="description">I discovered Cultura Positiva on my Instragram feed a couple of months ago. Every morning and afternoon they publish motivational posts. Their posts focus on self-love, respect, dignity, letting go, and understanding what truly matters. The posts are in Spanish, but I truly recommend you follow them. If you don't speak Spanish, you can follow @thegoodquote, who posts motivational posts as well.  </p>

	<li>Viva La Bonita</li>
	<p class="description">Viva La Bonita is a "Latina Lifestyle & Apparel Brand inspired by the spirit of the women who are fearless." Although they are a clothing brand, their apparel is genuine and empowering. They not only post the products they sell, but also post quotes and cool sayings. </p>

	<li>Were Not Really Strangers</li>
	<p class="description">"Were Not Really Strangers is a card game and movement all about creating meaningful connections with others." WNRS is a "red-themed" (will make sense when you see it, lol) account that posts quotes, pictures, and daily finds that remind us of how important we truly are, the impact we can have on this world, and the importance of human connection. </p>

	<li>Tyler Spangler</li>
	<p class="description">Tyler Spangler is a graphic designer who fills his instgram with illustrative type. Spangler uses type in bold, colorful, and powerful ways to create an inclusive community. He also creates portrait composites using different methods to create impactful images.  </p>

</ul>

<h2>Books</h2>

<section class="book">
<li>Lean In</li>
<p>Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO, wrote Lean In to describe what her journey has been like and explain her life as a woman in tech. She explores her self-doubt, how strongly she was underestimated, and what it takes to beat gender bias in order to reach equality and a diverse workplace. </p>

<li>The Universe Has Your Back</li>
<p>Gabrielle Bernstein wrote the Universe Has Your Back in order to transform the perception of fear into faith by letting go of insecurities and what holds us back. The stories she tells in the book guide readers to understand and find what they most long for: happiness, security and clear direction. The book is a quick read and honestly one of my favorite books I have ever read.  </p>


<li>The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</li>
<p>Behavioral Economics is one of the hottest, and newest academic topics which has transformed the way we understand human behavior.  Dan Ariely, is the author and pioneer in the field of Behavioral Economics. The book explores the why behind our decisions and choice and explains how those choices shape our world.   </p>
</ul>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p>On average, (specially living in Miami) I spend lots of time stuck in traffic, so in order to make my commute time shorter, I listen to podcasts. Here I listen to some of my favorites, which are available on streaming platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ted Podcasts</li>
<li>NPR Tiny Desk</li>
<li>Freakonomics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>These are some of my favorite videos. The people featured in these videos are individuals who due to certain circumstances have had to face obstacles and stand up to life itself in order to survive and beat stereotypes.</p>
