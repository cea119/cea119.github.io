<p>“Feel like you've stepped into an old New Orleans parlor from the jazz age” (minus Prohibition, lol). Lagniappe offers its guests live music every night and a wide variety of affordable wines and beers. It is a “cool, low-key” Midtown wine bar, also dishing up simple, grilled American fare; the cozy, homey interior and expansive light-strung “outside listening yard” provide a “great place to make a night of it with friends.”</p> </section>
